# 🚀 NASA Mission Timer Demo

This is a small, educational Python package that simulates a mission countdown timer with telemetry logging. It's built to reflect software development principles inspired by [NASA's NPR 7150.2D](https://nodis3.gsfc.nasa.gov/displayDir.cfm?Internal_ID=N_PR_7150_002D_). The project includes a structured codebase, documentation, and tests to demonstrate good engineering discipline.

> **Note:** This is a demo project for learning purposes. It is not intended for real-time, critical, or flight-grade use.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Build and package a modular countdown timer system
- Apply software engineering practices based on NPR 7150.2D
- Practice writing requirements, design docs, and test plans
- Implement a working telemetry logger with state control (pause/resume/reset)

---

## 📦 Installation

Clone the repo and install the package in editable mode:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jacksonbuilds/nasa-mission-timer-demo.git
cd nasa-mission-timer-demo
pip install -e .
```
This allows you to edit the code and immediately see changes when running or testing

## ▶️ Usage

You can run the timer from the command line:
```bash
python missiontimer/countdown_timer.py
```

## 🧪 Testing

Use pytest for automated unit testing

To run tests:
```bash
pytest
```
If needed, install it:
```bash
pip install pytest
```
